The Shapiro-Wilk test results indicate the following for each dataset: The p-value for the Youtube data is 0.0285, which is less than the significance level of 0.05. Therefore, you can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the Youtube data is not normally distributed. The p-value for the Instagram data is 0.4156, which is greater than the significance level. Thus, you cannot reject the null hypothesis, and the Instagram data is considered to be normally distributed. The p-value for the Facebook data is 0.1716, which is greater than the significance level. As with Instagram, you cannot reject the null hypothesis for the Facebook data, so it is also considered to be normally distributed. It's important to note that the Shapiro-Wilk test is sensitive to sample size, so with larger sample sizes, even small deviations from normality can lead to rejection of the null hypothesis. In practice, if your sample size is relatively large, you might observe significant results even if the deviations from normality are not practically significant. Additionally, visual inspection of histograms or Q-Q plots can also provide insights into the distribution of the data.
